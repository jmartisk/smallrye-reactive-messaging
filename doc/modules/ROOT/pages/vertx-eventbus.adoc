= Interacting with the Vert.x Eventbus

The Vert.x Eventbus is the backbone of Vert.x applications. It allows different application components to interact in
an asynchronous way.

== Dependency

To enable the Vert.x EventBus support, you need the following dependency:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>
  <artifactId>smallrye-reactive-messaging-vertx-eventbus</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Retrieving messages from the event bus

[source]
----
mp.messaging.incoming.data.address=<the-eventbus-address>
mp.messaging.incoming.data.connector=smallrye-vertx-eventbus
mp.messaging.incoming.data.use-reply-as-ack=<true|false>
mp.messaging.incoming.data.broadcast=<true|false>
----

The `address` indicates from which event bus address the messages are retrieved. `use-reply-as-ack` instructs the
framework to reply to the event bus message as acknowledgement mechanism. Finally, the `broadcast` entry broadcasts the
to many subscribers.

The received messages are instance of `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.eventbus.EventBusMessage`. The payload is the message
body. From the `EventBusMessage`, you can retrieve the headers, address...

== Sending messages to the event bus

[source]
----
mp.messaging.outgoing.data.address=<the-eventbus-address>
mp.messaging.outgoing.data.connector=smallrye-vertx-eventbus
mp.messaging.outgoing.data.publish=<true|false>
mp.messaging.outgoing.data.expect-reply=<true|false>
mp.messaging.outgoing.data.codec=<codec-name>
mp.messaging.outgoing.data.timeout=1000
----

The `address` indicates where the messages are sent. `publish` choose whether the message is sent to a single consumer (
`false`) or broadcast (`true`). `expect-reply` indicates if you expect a reply. No other messages will be sent until the
reply is received. `codec` is the name of the codec (it must have been registered explicitly). Finally, the `timeout`
specifies the reply timeout.

The event bus message is created from the Reactive Messaging message. The payload is passed as body.
