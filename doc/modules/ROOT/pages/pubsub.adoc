= Interacting with Google Cloud Pub/Sub

You can connect to Google Cloud Pub/Sub as a source or sink. The Pub/Sub support is based on the https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-client-libraries#pubsub-client-libraries-java[Google Cloud Pub/Sub Client].

== Dependency

To enable the Google Cloud Pub/Sub support, you need the following dependency:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>
  <artifactId>smallrye-reactive-messaging-gcp-pubsub</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Retrieving messages from Google Cloud Pub/Sub

To retrieve messages from a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic, you need the following configuration:

[source]
----
# [Source - heartbeat] - Consume data from Google Cloud Pub/Sub
mp.messaging.incoming.pubsub-heartbeat.connector=smallrye-gcp-pubsub
mp.messaging.incoming.pubsub-heartbeat.topic=heartbeat
mp.messaging.incoming.pubsub-heartbeat.subscription=heartbeat-subscription
# [/Source - heartbeat]
----

The `connector` attribute is required to indicate you are configuring the Google Cloud Pub/Sub transport. Supported attributes are listed
in the following table:

|===
| Attribute | Mandatory | Default | Description
| topic | true | the `channel-name` | The topic to consume, use the `channel-name` if not set
| subscription | true | N/A | The subscription name to consume
| credential-path | false | Read credentials from environment variables | Optional path to a GCP Service Account credentials file (.json)
|===

When consuming a message from Google Cloud Pub/Sub, you can get the `Message` as a `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.gcp.pubsub.PubSubMessage`.
It lets you access other metadata such as the headers, the message key (the payload being the value).

== Forwarding messages to Google Cloud Pub/Sub

To send messages to a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic, you need the following configuration:

[source]
----
# [Sink - data] - Produce data to Google Cloud Pub/Sub
mp.messaging.outgoing.data.connector=smallrye-gcp-pubsub
mp.messaging.outgoing.data.topic=data
# [/Sink - data]
----

The `connector` attribute is required to indicate you are configuring the Google Cloud Pub/Sub transport. Supported attributes are listed
in the following table:

|===
| Attribute | Mandatory | Default | Description
| topic | true | the `channel-name` | The topic to consume, use the `channel-name` if not set
| credential-path | false | Read credentials from environment variables | Optional path to a GCP Service Account credentials file (.json)
