SmallRye Reactive Messaging is an implementation of the (next to be) Eclipse MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification.
It provides a way to implement reactive data streaming application using a CDI development model.

It provides:

* a development model to build data streaming applications
* connections for Apache Kafka, AMQP 1.0, MQTT, Apache Camel...
* a way to inject manipulated streams into regular CDI beans and JAX-RS resources


SmallRye Reactive Messaging enables data streaming application, event-driven and asynchronous microservices, event
sourcing applications...
