= Acknowledgement

Messages may require acknowledgment to inform the transport layer that the message has been processed. Methods
annotated with `@Incoming` and also be annotated with `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Acknowledgment` to
configure the acknowledgement policies.

Four policies are supported:

* `NONE`: no acknowledgement
* `MANUAL`: the developer is responsible for the acknowledgement. It can be perform using `Message.ack()`.
* `PRE_PROCESSING`: the acknowledgement is managed automatically before the processing
* `POST_PROCESSING`: the acknowledgement is managed automatically after the processing


The following example describes how `PRE_PROCESSING` can be configured:

[source,java]
----
include::example$Ack.java[tag=pre]
----

Manual acknowledgement can be achieved as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::example$Ack.java[tag=manual]
----

Default acknowledgement depends on the method signature:
